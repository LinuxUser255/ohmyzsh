# Custom Oh-My-Zsh with Built-in zsh-syntax-highlighting and zsh-autosuggestions

This is a customized version of oh-my-zsh that has `zsh-syntax-highlighting` and `zsh-autosuggestions` **built-in** and automatically loaded.

## What's Different?

Unlike the standard oh-my-zsh installation where you need to:
1. Clone the plugins separately
2. Add them to your `.zshrc` plugins list

This custom version:
- **Includes both plugins directly** in the `plugins/` directory
- **Automatically loads them** whenever oh-my-zsh is sourced
- **No configuration required** - they just work out of the box

## Installation

### Option 1: Use as Your Main oh-my-zsh

If you want to use this as your primary oh-my-zsh installation, update your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
# Replace or set these lines in your ~/.zshrc
export ZSH="$HOME/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/ohmyzsh"
source "$ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh"

# You can still customize your plugins list if needed
# plugins=(git docker kubectl)
```

### Option 2: Test Before Switching

To test this setup without modifying your current configuration:

```bash
# Run the test script
~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/ohmyzsh/test_integration.sh
```

Or start a new zsh session with this oh-my-zsh:

```bash
ZSH="$HOME/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/ohmyzsh" zsh
```

## What's Included

### 1. zsh-autosuggestions
- Automatically suggests commands as you type based on command history
- Location: `~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/ohmyzsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/`
- **Auto-loaded**: Yes, no configuration needed

### 2. zsh-syntax-highlighting
- Real-time syntax highlighting for commands
- Highlights valid/invalid commands, paths, etc.
- Location: `~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/ohmyzsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/`
- **Auto-loaded**: Yes, no configuration needed

## How It Works

The custom integration modifies `oh-my-zsh.sh` to automatically source both plugins after loading user-configured plugins:

```zsh
# Auto-load built-in zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlighting
# These are loaded after user plugins to ensure they are always active
if [[ -f "$ZSH/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.plugin.zsh" ]]; then
  source "$ZSH/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.plugin.zsh"
fi

if [[ -f "$ZSH/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.plugin.zsh" ]]; then
  source "$ZSH/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.plugin.zsh"
fi
```

## Benefits

1. **No manual setup** - Both plugins work immediately
2. **Always enabled** - Can't forget to add them to your plugins list
3. **Consistent experience** - Same setup across different machines
4. **Easy to share** - Just distribute this oh-my-zsh directory

## Customization

You can still customize the behavior of these plugins using environment variables in your `.zshrc` **before** sourcing oh-my-zsh:

### zsh-autosuggestions customization:
```zsh
# Change highlight color
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE='fg=240'

# Change suggestion strategy
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_STRATEGY=(history completion)
```

### zsh-syntax-highlighting customization:
```zsh
# Define which highlighters to use
ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_HIGHLIGHTERS=(main brackets pattern)

# Customize colors
ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[command]='fg=green,bold'
```

## Updating Plugins

To update the built-in plugins to their latest versions:

```bash
# Update zsh-autosuggestions
cd ~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/zsh-autosuggestions
git pull
cp -r ~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/zsh-autosuggestions ~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/ohmyzsh/plugins/

# Update zsh-syntax-highlighting
cd ~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/zsh-syntax-highlighting
git pull
cp -r ~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/zsh-syntax-highlighting ~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/ohmyzsh/plugins/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugins not loading?

Check if the plugin files exist:
```bash
ls -la ~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/ohmyzsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/
ls -la ~/Projects/ZSH-Stuff/ohmyzsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/
```

### Conflicts with existing setup?

Make sure you're not loading these plugins twice (once manually, once automatically).

### Performance issues?

Both plugins are loaded automatically. If you experience slowness, you can disable them by commenting out the auto-load section in `oh-my-zsh.sh`.
